Research and Development is at the heart of everything we do at Tapal and allows us to continuously innovate and delight our consumers. Our commitment to experiment and research until we develop the perfect blend sets Tapal Tea apart from the rest.
The Tapal Tea Lab, a room of experts, is where the core research and development activity takes place which enables our experts to create unique blends, using a combination of different tea grades. Assorted teas are masterfully mixed in a drum right before packaging to retain consistent quality, flavor, and freshness. Our tea tasters test and evaluate various blends to ensure that you get consistently superior quality, every time.
