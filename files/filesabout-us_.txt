About Us


For three generations, Tapal Tea has consistently ensured to offer consumers across Pakistan and around the world the distinct Tapal flavor developed by blending premium tea leaves; handpicked from select gardens in the world.

Our Purpose


Tapal Tea is the market leader of branded tea in Pakistan. We are guided by our values and principles to bring calmness and relaxation in the lives of our consumers through our aromatic and flavorful teas. By keeping a close watch on the likes and preferences of our consumers, we have constantly enhanced our range of tea brands that cater to varying requirements and tastes of our consumers who belong to all ages and live in different regions of the world. The finest blends of Tapal have gathered the world around our cup of tea.

The company was founded in 1947 and we started our operations by importing tea from Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). Soon after Tapal introduced its pioneering brand Family Mixture, which still is regarded the preferred tea brand for families in the market. Tapal ventured into exports when we introduced our teas in the Saudi Arabia market. Now Tapal has made its mark in 6 continents and over 15 countries across North and South America, Asia, Europe and Africa.

Our market leading status is backed by a strong research and development unit, which works arduously and supports the operations unit by developing new and innovative tea grades at its Tapal Tea Lab.

Today, millions of consumers across Pakistan and around the world are obsessed with Tapal Tea brands, for whom our teas have become an essential and integral part of their lives. Our promise to our consumers is to continue enriching their lives by maintaining our high standards and constantly introducing more innovative variants of teas in future.
