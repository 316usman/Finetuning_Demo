International Women’s Day

This International Women’s Day we celebrated with our esteemed guest Halima Iqbal, founder of Oraan Committee, the first digital committee platform led by Women for Women, and Syeda Sadaf Shah, First Female drilling Engineer of Sindh. Both are success stories in their own fields. Their struggles and stories truly inspired us to #breakthebias

The celebration also included a few activities to demonstrate workplace biases we face and how to break them together.
